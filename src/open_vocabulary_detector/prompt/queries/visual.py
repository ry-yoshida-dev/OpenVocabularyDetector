class VisualQuery:
    """
    Reference images querying a class together, e.g. several photos of the same mug.

    The L2-normalized embeddings of every box of every reference are averaged into one query. Give appearances
    that differ (a sedan and a van) as separate queries instead, so each is scored on its own.

    Attributes
    ----------
    references : tuple[VisualReference, ...]
        Reference images with boxes around the queried instances.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If there is no reference or one reference is given twice.
